simple_blog
===========
This was my first full CRUD app that I wrote using Sinatra. I made it during Week 4 of Dev Bootcamp. In this blog app, users can create, edit, and delete posts, and they can tag posts with any number of tags. A tag can apply to any number of posts. A user can view anyone's blog posts, but can only edit their own. They can search posts by user or by tag, or see all recent posts. It was also among my first attempts at coherent styling with CSS.

Since then, my Git practices have gotten much better, and I've learned some things about security, performance, and usability, but this was still an important step in my learning process.
